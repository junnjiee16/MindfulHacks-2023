Thus, you may not detect signs\nof ADHD in your young ones until they enter childcare or kindergarten.\nChildren\u2019s symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention) become more\napparent when they are unable to participate fruitfully in daily classroom\nactivities. These issues may prompt concerned teachers to contact the\nchildren\u2019s parents.\n\n![Hyperactive child with ADHD playing with\nleaves](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ic4HXm2fuGslKRXG96HPCELS5j4TrpIgaPZL0XZxtYLATw_PqMgkECM5OeuVPXZPMOsYEaTcvQMFb7Y0jdAycEWVACYnErt3VD3AbSOEmVWqo-\naF4Tju9o6_JXYdbigvHtjRscsM7x569dju)_Image Source: Unsplash \u2013 Scott Webb_\n\nIf you are a parent who has been contacted by a teacher for a reason, you may\nbe at a loss as to what to do next. Your child\u2019s teachers may have recommended\nan assessment by a paediatrician, but you may require further information\nabout the process.\n\n## **What can you do if you suspect your child has ADHD?**\n\nTo get a better understanding of how ADHD shows up in children, check out this\narticle: [\u201cWhat ADHD looks like in\nchildren\u201d](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/what-adhd-looks-like-in-children/).\nFor a handy overview on getting your child through the local healthcare\nsystem, take a look at this article: \u201c[Who do I seek if I suspect I have\nADHD?](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/who-should-i-see-if-i-suspect-i-have-\nadhd/)\u201d\n\nConsider getting professional advice from a hospital paediatrician.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81348e05-5b35-4c42-9e5a-5ae3652d0d66": {"__data__": {"id_": "81348e05-5b35-4c42-9e5a-5ae3652d0d66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a6a9c945d03cd55cab134893e26989d812c1fc553a1aa9dbe0359663090b693c", "text": "Your child\u2019s teachers may have recommended\nan assessment by a paediatrician, but you may require further information\nabout the process.\n\n## **What can you do if you suspect your child has ADHD?**\n\nTo get a better understanding of how ADHD shows up in children, check out this\narticle: [\u201cWhat ADHD looks like in\nchildren\u201d](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/what-adhd-looks-like-in-children/).\nFor a handy overview on getting your child through the local healthcare\nsystem, take a look at this article: \u201c[Who do I seek if I suspect I have\nADHD?](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/who-should-i-see-if-i-suspect-i-have-\nadhd/)\u201d\n\nConsider getting professional advice from a hospital paediatrician. [Kandang\nKerbau Hospital (KKH) \u2019s Department of Child\nDevelopment](https://www.kkh.com.sg/patient-care/areas-of-care/childrens-\nservices/Pages/child-development.aspx) and the [National University Hospital\n(NUH)\u2019s Child Development Unit](https://www.nuh.com.sg/our-\nservices/Specialties/Paediatrics/Pages/Developmental-and-Behavioural-\nPaediatrics.aspx) specialise in developmental and behavioural paediatrics.\nThey are multi-disciplinary teams that comprise paediatricians, psychologists,\noccupational therapists, speech therapists, educational therapists and medical\nsocial workers. They typically see children from birth to 7 years of age.\n\nTo make an appointment, visit any polyclinic with your child and get a\nreferral letter to your hospital of choice. Upon seeing a paediatrician at\neither of the aforementioned hospitals, they will assess your child and plan\nfor the next steps. If a diagnosis is required, an appointment will be made\nwith the department\u2019s psychologist.\n\n## **Therapy for children with ADHD symptoms**\n\nChildren with ADHD symptoms will also benefit from therapeutic interventions,\nsuch as occupational therapy or educational therapy. A diagnosis is not\nnecessary for a child to obtain therapy for their learning or behavioural\nneeds. Sessions typically include caregivers so that they can apply the\nstrategies with their children at home.\n\n![ADHD child playing with building blocks to build\nskills](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GmOmAXhm3Obi7sfBGnoxlqar66A_H4wLZ5srq_DzH5ZHG5ZYhDK6l_zAoBpTe0Kd0ouE0llmjEVrcVnITLyGeAiz4rb0uQWRjAaWdNjiydHteOuVzk_5wYCAbJ3b05lRv5EygeMoW17ZiOOH)_Image\nSource: Unsplash \u2013 La-Rel Easter_\n\nAn occupational therapist can help with strategies to develop a child\u2019s social\nskills, executive functioning, attention and concentration.

Children with ADHD are not required to see a\nspeech therapist unless they display the above difficulties.\n\nChildren who require long-term intervention will be referred to appropriate\ncommunity services.\n\n## **What is the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?**\n\nChild psychologists typically provide psychological assessments to make a\ndiagnosis and provide psychological therapy. The main difference between a\npsychologist and a psychiatrist is that a child can only get medication with\nthe latter. Children with ADHD symptoms are recommended to go through therapy\nto manage their symptoms. Medication may be considered if they are still\nstruggling to manage their symptoms. If you have mixed feelings about\nmedication, check out this article: [\u201cShould I or Should I Not Medicate My\nChild?\u201d](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/should-i-medicate-or-not-medicate-my-\nchild/)\n\nIf you feel that medications are required, discuss this with your child\u2019s\npaediatrician for a recommendation. While medication can help with some of the\nADHD symptoms, it is still important to apply strategies learned from the\ntherapy sessions at the same time.\n\n## **Recommended Readings**\n\n  1. <https://www.kkh.com.sg/sites/shcommonassets/Assets/conditions-treatments/images/kkh/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-kkh.pdf>\n  2. <https://www.singhealth.com.sg/patient-care/conditions-treatments/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-growing-up/>\n  3. <https://www.kkh.com.sg/news/medical-news-singhealth/helping-children-with-developmental-needs>\n  4.

I was right. While the title of this session\nalludes to discussions on psychiatric treatments for ADHD, the talk covered a\nwide range of topics.\n\n## **On ADHD Diagnoses**\n\nWhile many often think of a [diagnosis ](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/whats-\nexpected-in-an-adhd-diagnosis/)as nothing but bad news, Dr Hallowell believes\nthat this is not necessarily the case. Calling it a \u201cgood-news diagnosis\u201d, he\nreasons that the situation can only get better after knowing about the\nunderlying ADHD.\n\n  * If you are the parent of an ADHDer, a diagnosis can point you in the right direction and allow you to adopt appropriate parenting practices. \n  * ADHD is a **_wiring issue_** rather than a **_willpower issue_** , and ADHD is not a case of your child \u201cnot trying hard enough\u201d. Understanding this can spare you and your child a lot of unnecessary stress and frustration.\n\n## **On ADHD Treatment**\n\nAccording to Dr Vinson, \u201cThe best treatment isn\u2019t always the \u2018gold-standard\u2019\ntreatment \u2013 it\u2019s what is indicated as medically effective **and** something\nthe patient and their family is willing and able to do.\u201d\n\n[Stimulant medication](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/manage-your-meds/) such\nas Ritalin is often lauded as the best option and main component of ADHD\ntreatment.

For example, a big difference can be made by incorporating daily reminders and regular exercise.\n  3.  **Option of Medication:** Dr Hallowell offers the option of medication, but with less emphasis than on the above two components.\n\n## **On Other Resources**\n\nIt is not always possible to access the medical or therapeutic help that is\nneeded for ADHD treatment. Thus, here are some other options:\n\n  * ADHD organisations \u2013 in our local context, it would be [Unlocking ADHD](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/) and [Spark Singapore](http://www.spark.org.sg/)\n  * [Books on ADHD](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/category/book-reviews/) e.g., Driven to Distraction, [ADHD 2.0](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/adhd-2-0/) (lots of self-help tips), \n  * Magazines e.g.,[ ADDitude](https://www.additudemag.com/), \n  * Social media, e.g. [Unlocking ADHD\u2019s Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UnlockingADHD.Asia/), etc. \n  * Work with your child\u2019s teachers for a better learning environment\n  * Exercising\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWhen a child is diagnosed with ADHD, the child\u2019s parents often descend into a\nspiral of worry and despair. However, Dr Hallowell stresses that parents\nshould not fear the diagnosis. Rather, parents should fear ignorance.\nIgnorance is what leads to bad treatments, bad outcomes, stigmas and\neverything negative.

How do you go about choosing the right professionals?\n\n## **Psychiatrist or Psychologist?**\n\nSome people believe that psychiatrists and psychologists are the same, and\nthat could not be further from the truth. They are vastly different\nprofessions. [Psychiatry](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-\nis-psychiatry-menu) is a branch of Science concentrated around mental,\nemotional and behavioural issues. Psychiatrists go through medical school and\nare able to dispense medications. They are also able to diagnose and give\nassessments to clients. They are often more focused on the chemical or\nbiological aspects of mental health. ([More\ninfo](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/which-professionals-are-involved-in-the-\ndiagnosis-of-adhd/))\n\n[Psychology ](https://www.verywellmind.com/psychology-4014660)is the study of\nthe human mind and behaviour. Most psychologists in\n[Singapore](https://singaporepsychologicalsociety.org/srp-faqs/) will likely\nhave a Masters or PhD in Psychology. Psychologists are able to diagnose and\ngive assessments to clients, however, they are not able to dispense\nmedications. A psychologist is likely to be more focused on a client\u2019s\nemotional well-being and likely sees them more often than a psychiatrist\nwould.\n\nThus, it is important to consider what your aim in getting a diagnosis is, and\nwhether part of that aim is to try out ADHD medication. Usually, seeing both a\npsychiatrist _and_ a psychologist will help clients to manage symptoms\neffectively.\n\n## **Private or Public?**\n\nThere are many psychiatrists available in both the public and private health\nsectors. When deciding to get an assessment, it is good to look at the pros\nand cons of both. ([More info](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/do-you-suspect-\nthat-you-have-adhd/))\n\nIf you are a Singaporean citizen, public healthcare, whether mental or\nphysical, is [subsidised](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-\nschemes-subsidies/subsidies-for-services-and-drugs-at-public-healthcare-\nsettings). To receive an ADHD assessment, you would need a referral. This\nreferral can be obtained from a polyclinic or your primary care physician.\nThus, this route would cost less, but may take a longer time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4f183be-2535-4d99-ae42-80ac1a7338dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4f183be-2535-4d99-ae42-80ac1a7338dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "c024f0b4105a495a77cbce8821ffa47c4cb0200979c28bee2d719f321908368e", "text": "When deciding to get an assessment, it is good to look at the pros\nand cons of both. ([More info](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/do-you-suspect-\nthat-you-have-adhd/))\n\nIf you are a Singaporean citizen, public healthcare, whether mental or\nphysical, is [subsidised](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-\nschemes-subsidies/subsidies-for-services-and-drugs-at-public-healthcare-\nsettings). To receive an ADHD assessment, you would need a referral. This\nreferral can be obtained from a polyclinic or your primary care physician.\nThus, this route would cost less, but may take a longer time. Additionally,\nthere is often a long wait time to get an appointment with a psychiatrist in\nthe public healthcare system and even longer to get an assessment. (See our\n[Healthcare Directory](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/healthcare-directory/))\n\nPrivate healthcare, on the other hand, would be significantly faster. However,\nit would also be much more expensive. To get an appointment, you would simply\nneed to pick up the phone and dial the office. Since private doctors naturally\nhave a lesser number of clientele, you would not have to wait long for the\nassessment. The upside is that private doctors often cost a lot. For example,\na private psychiatrist at[ Raffles Medical\n](https://www.rafflesmedicalgroup.com/services/specialist-\ncentres/counselling/consultation-fees/)could cost $214 with GST. Assessments\nmay also cost more.\n\n## **Other Things of Note**\n\nNo matter what mental health professional you see, it is important you find\none that listens to you and is knowledgeable about their field. [For\ninstance](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a75d2f2c027d8bcb6dae62b/t/5a8cd6f553450a39afe1b9d9/1519179509964/Red+Flags+in+Psychiatrists.pdf),\na psychiatrist that says \u201cyou can\u2019t have ADHD because you have good grades\u201d\nwould not be a psychiatrist you want to continue seeing. This example shows\nthe psychiatrist giving a clear disregard for the patient\u2019s feelings and\nrigidly basing their diagnosis criteria on outdated stereotypes.\n\nA [\u201cgood\u201d](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/shrink-rap-\ntoday/201201/what-makes-good-psychiatrist) mental health professional is\nsomeone who is respectful of their client\u2019s feelings and wishes. They are\ntransparent about side effects different treatments may bring, respect\nconfidentiality and give assessments based on current scientific research, not\noutdated stereotypes. They understand that diagnostic criteria is not \u201cone\nsize fits all\u201d.\n\nFinally, being clear of why you want an assessment or diagnosis in the first\nplace is important. This aim will help to guide you in the process of finding\nthe right mental health professional for you. Though a mental health\nprofessional may check all the boxes and be objectively \u201cgood\u201d, if you are not\ncomfortable around them, it is time to look for someone else.

But nervous\nparents still must educate themselves to see how the positives of medication\nfar outweigh the negatives.\n\nA, [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/children-who-dont-get-\nadhd-treatment-can-have-long-lasting-problems-into-adulthood-051215#Potential-\nRisks-of-Not-Treating-ADHD) article referred to a study done in 2003 which was\npublished in _The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry_. The study describes the\nsituation that when ADHD goes unmedicated, individuals with ADHD are 3 to 4\ntimes more likely to develop substance abuse issues. The reason is that when\nADHD goes untreated or is not treated correctly, it causes issues such as\nadverse childhood experiences, addiction, and other psychological problems\nthroughout that person\u2019s life.\n\nI know this because I wasn\u2019t allowed to take medication for ADHD, which left\nme wondering what was wrong with me for years. During that time, I believed I\nwas just lazy and stupid, and other untrue things people with ADHD are led to\nbelieve because of the stigma attached to this misunderstood condition.\n\nMy best advice for nervous parents is to write down their beliefs and\nhesitations about medication and not go online for their main information\nsource. After you write these down, ask your child\u2019s physician, therapist or\npharmacist if it\u2019s alright if they talk to you about those concerns.\n\nDiscuss ways they think might be helpful to empower you to gain a healthier\nunderstanding of medication. Accepting that as a parent, it\u2019s natural to be\nnervous about such a hot topic. It is also critical not to let our stigmatized\nbeliefs dictate our decision-making because it makes us feel powerless over\nthose beliefs when we do this.\n\nIt\u2019s more important to remind yourself that while you may not know everything\nabout treating ADHD, you are willing to learn.

If you talk about medication, their challenges, and their\ndiagnosis in a way that invalidates them, it can make them feel as if they\u2019re\nweak or a burden.\n\nThe same goes for your online language because it\u2019ll indirectly show your\nchild that you think their challenges are irrelevant and other untrue things.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s critical to speak in a supportive and empathetic way and\nto do your best to see them from their perspective.\n\nHere are a few things that parents can do to create healthy conversations\nabout medication.\n\n  * Instead of talking about medication like it\u2019s a performance enhancer and other incorrect things, talk about it for what it is. A tool to be used in combination with other interventions like therapy, coping skills for dealing with emotional regulation, and impulse control to effectively treat complex conditions like ADHD and other mental illnesses. \n  * Remember not to talk about medication being made up by \u201cbig pharma\u201d because medication saves lives. \n  * If you say something that your ADHDer considers hurtful such as stigmatized beliefs or pill shaming, own it and apologize. This simple act shows you care about how they think and feel, and as a person whose parents didn\u2019t do this, I can tell you that this is hurtful and can lead to adverse childhood experiences. \n\nI want parents to remember that having healthy conversations about ADHD isn\u2019t\njust about medication. It\u2019s also about things like emotional vulnerabilities,\ntriggers, challenges, and anything related to your child\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nFor this reason, nervous parents must understand their erroneous beliefs\naround those things because what you do and say impacts more than you realize.\nIn addition, most people don\u2019t realize a child with ADHD hears more than\n20,000 [abusive comments](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-and-\nshame/) before 12. For this reason, it\u2019s critical for parents not only to\nempower their ADHDer but to gain an understanding of their responsibility,\neven if it means stepping outside their comfort zone.\n\nAnother [article](https://www.additudemag.com/how-to-be-a-better-parent-adhd-\nchild/) I wrote about my childhood and how my parents did not take my ADHD\nseriously is also a great tool to use in combination with the above tips.\n\n* _Sandy Pace is a Canadian author and advocate, and an aspiring peer support specialist in Western Canada.

For more details, do watch the\nrecording of the webinar below.\n\nKicking off ADHD Awareness Month 2021 with our October 1 launch, Unlocking\nADHD had guest speaker, [Dr Dan\nShapiro](http://www.parentchildjourney.com/about/), renowned US\n[Developmental-Behavioural Pediatrician\n](https://www.understood.org/articles/en/developmental-behavioral-\npediatricians-what-you-need-to-know)and Creator of [Parent Child\nJourney](http://www.parentchildjourney.com/) shared on the hot button issue of\nADHD medication for children \u2013 a struggle that parents commonly face when\ntheir child is diagnosed with [Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n(ADHD)](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/what-is-adhd/).\n\nMedication management is a key cornerstone of therapy. According to Dr Dan,\nwhen one makes a diagnosis of ADHD, medication should always be part of a\ncomprehensive management plan. He has written three books: _Parent Child\nJourney: An Individualized Approach to Raising Your Challenging Child_ ,\n_Parent Child Excursions: ADHD, Anxiety and Aut_ ism and _Raph\u2019s Tale_ , a\nchildren\u2019s book on developmental difference. _Parent Child Journey_ provides\ndetails on medication management and non pharmacologic approaches to behaviour\nmanagement. There is also an accompanying parent training program, which Dr\nDan runs. He believes in the importance of good behaviour management, good\neducational care, and good family support.\n\n## **Topics Covered**\n\n### **Diagnosis of ADHD**\n\nDr Dan listed inattentive as well as hyperactive and impulsive\n[symptoms](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/spotting-adhd-symptoms-in-children-\nand-teens/) of ADHD. The combined type of both inattentive and hyperactive-\nimpulsive features is the most common.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32b398e3-b63c-462c-8dec-ecea2bd2e366": {"__data__": {"id_": "32b398e3-b63c-462c-8dec-ecea2bd2e366", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "f76e0f0249760b261b5b2753f0513ce96fddfca52dac809c5dc2d89cdf267118", "text": "_Parent Child Journey_ provides\ndetails on medication management and non pharmacologic approaches to behaviour\nmanagement.

The combined type of both inattentive and hyperactive-\nimpulsive features is the most common. He emphasized that these subtypes are\nartificial as the symptoms change over time. Thus the subtype is based on\nsymptoms over the past 6 months. Often there are hyperactive-impulsive\nfeatures early in life that reduce over the years.\n\nDr Dan highlighted that most inattentive behaviours are not ADHD. There can be\nmany causes of inattention that are not a subject of ADHD management.\nTherefore, unless there is impairment across settings, over time, and across\nobservers, there is no case for a diagnosis of a disorder \u2013 they are of normal\ntemperament variation.\n\n### **The Case for Medication Management**\n\n![medication](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iq-\nhSjd3mEpqH6fv3o9Wmq0ZbyHZm30OtzwNJt_X2BXx57HMc6BsKniZhmsDleRyW7r78-Kmjhjb9WEUKFv68EZvsX_zvozefgriXHoflAFpOA_wVp1g2VpU0yPc5g=s1600)Image\nCredit: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/1TL8AoEDj_c)\n\nMedication management is usually an uncomfortable topic for parents who are\nnew to the idea of brain-based developmental differences. Dr Dan shared that\nthis is not cosmetic psychopharmacology \u2013 there is a misconception that we\ntreat attention problems just to enhance our child\u2019s ability to perform and\ncompete. That is a harmful myth \u2013 ADHD is a legitimate brain-based\ndisorder/neuro developmental problem with consequences from failure to treat\nsuch as a 30-50% increased risk of a whole list of problems and comorbidities.\n\nDr Dan also shared medical research results that started as early as 1938 to a\nmore recent _Medicines Therapy Assessment [MTA]_ study that showed the\neffectiveness of medication management.\n\n### **How to do a Medication Trial**\n\n![medication trial](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-9-1024x689.png)Image Credit: [Parent Child\nJourney](http://www.parentchildjourney.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/08/stimulant-trial-form-meds-protocol-\nrevised-8.2.2017-2.pdf)\n\nDr Dan shared on how to do a medication trial, with free tools and resources\navailable on the [Parent Child Journey\nwebsite](http://www.parentchildjourney.com/). He took the participants of the\nwebinar briefly through the steps of:\n\n  * Choosing a target\n  * Choosing a medication\n  * Establishing baseline measures for targets and possible side effects\n  * Establishing observation intervals\n  * Observing\n  * Evaluating and re-evaluating\n\nDr Dan also walked parents through the important do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of how to\ntalk to their child about ADHD medication and shared very useful tips on\ncommunicating with children.\n\n### **Filling Troughs**\n\nDr Dan explained that we need to be aware of uneven medication coverage that\nneeds to be managed. From the time a medication dose is given, there is a\nkick-in time (trough), then duration of action (where medication is at\ntherapeutic level), and finally a kick-out time (second trough).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e72550f4-ac23-44dc-88b4-1414a1d3ed6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e72550f4-ac23-44dc-88b4-1414a1d3ed6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "db8becfc0bc194b3a30ac5668ac96b6cfb8d9c161e6968a91062ada680c25ee1", "text": "He took the participants of the\nwebinar briefly through the steps of:\n\n  * Choosing a target\n  * Choosing a medication\n  * Establishing baseline measures for targets and possible side effects\n  * Establishing observation intervals\n  * Observing\n  * Evaluating and re-evaluating\n\nDr Dan also walked parents through the important do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of how to\ntalk to their child about ADHD medication and shared very useful tips on\ncommunicating with children.\n\n### **Filling Troughs**\n\nDr Dan explained that we need to be aware of uneven medication coverage that\nneeds to be managed. From the time a medication dose is given, there is a\nkick-in time (trough), then duration of action (where medication is at\ntherapeutic level), and finally a kick-out time (second trough). We need to\nmanage these troughs as there are potential negative effects and\nmisunderstanding to [Trough-filling failures\n(TFF)](http://www.parentchildjourney.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/12/Attention_Fall2017_Peaks-and-Troughs-in-ADHD-med-\ncoverage.pdf). There are all sorts of strategies to filling these troughs and\nthey are further elaborated in Dr Dan\u2019s website, books, and other workshops.\n\n### **Managing Side Effects**\n\nSide effects of medication can be managed in a few ways \u2013 medication can be\ndiscontinued or monitored, behaviour accommodated, or we can treat the side\neffects. The generalisation is that side-effects should not be tolerated if\nthey are significant. Some side effects are relatively minor, e.g. going to\nbed 10 minutes later is a minor trade-off if medications are working\nbeautifully, but conversely going to bed 4 hours later should not be\ntolerated. There are many strategies for evaluating and treating side-effects\nas detailed in Dr Dan\u2019s book.\n\n### **Discontinuation**\n\nWhat are some of the considerations to discontinue medication? How does one go\nabout it? Some reasons provided by Dr Dan include:\n\n  * To see if medication is still needed\n\n30% of childhood ADHD symptoms improve enough that you do not need treatment\nas an adult. However, about 70% of children with ADHD end up needing\nmedication as adults. The only way to tell if it is still needed is to do a\ndiscontinuation trial.\n\n  * To see if medication is causing a side-effect \n\nSometimes discontinuation happens in an accidental way (e.g. the child has\nforgotten to take medication or has run out of medication). It is much better\nto do test discontinuation in a controlled way.\n\nWebinar attendees were given a deeper understanding into how[ ADHD\nmedication](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/manage-your-meds/) works, how to\nease their child into establishing a medication\n[routine](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/setting-routines-for-children-and-\nteens/), and the potential[ side\neffects](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/common-side-effects-of-medication/) it\nmight carry.\n\n**[** ** _If you liked this story and found it helpful, please SHARE_**\n**it.** ** _For more personal stories about ADHDers, please click_**[ **\n_here_**](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/category/personal-stories-\nadult,personal-stories,personal-stories-youth/) ** _.

This executive function, or\nthe \u201cCEO of the brain\u201d is responsible for tasks like planning, organization,\nprioritisation, learning from mistakes, maintaining focus, and our short-term\nworking memory.\n\nThe more intense the workout, the more your brain likes it!\n\n  * Start your day off with a workout, which can have a beneficial impact on your prefrontal cortex for 2-3 hours.\n  * During the day, plan a \u201cworkout snack\u201d either by doing a brisk walk, or going up and down the stairs.\n\nDepending on your age, workout intensity and type of workout can differ.\n\n  * For younger kids with ADHD, the more the movement the better.

If so, you\u2019re already somewhat familiar\nwith how behaviour therapy works.\n\nBehaviour therapy essentially entails a structured manner of rewarding desired\nbehaviour and delivering consequences for undesirable behaviour. It aims to\nincrease preferred behaviour and eliminate unconstructive ones.\n\nCiting its effectiveness in improving children\u2019s behaviour, self-control and\nself-esteem, the US Centre for Disease Control\n([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/behavior-therapy.html)) recommends\nbeginning with behaviour therapy before embarking on medication for children\nbelow six.\n\nMost psychology clinics will have psychologists trained to carry out behaviour\ntherapy with your child. Hospitals with Psychological Medicine divisions, such\nas [KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital](https://www.kkh.com.sg/patient-\ncare/areas-of-care/childrens-services/Pages/child-and-adolescent.aspx), would\nalso likely be able to provide behaviour therapy. Parents may also receive\ntraining and carry out behaviour therapy on their own.\n\nWhile these do not substitute proper training from professional psychologists,\nhere are some tips from\n[ADDitude](https://www.additudemag.com/download/alternative-adhd-treatment-\nguide/) magazine to get you started:\n\n  * Start with just one to two behaviours you want to encourage or eliminate\n  * Set clear and realistic expectations and communicate them to your child\n  * Be consistent in rewarding and meting out consequences\n  * Focus more on the positives and be patient\n\n## **Occupational Therapy**\n\nSometimes, it isn\u2019t specific behaviours that need to be addressed.

This is\nbecause misbehaviour and emotional outbursts are usually easier to detect than\nlearning difficulties. Learning difficulties may only become apparent at\nhigher levels of schooling, when reading and writing tasks become more\nchallenging.

Such disorders are usually\nmultifactorial. Contributing factors include brain chemistry, genetics and the\nenvironment. ADHDers are more likely to receive criticism2, struggle with\nsocialising and have issues with emotional regulation3. Therefore, it comes as\nno surprise that some of them develop co-morbid disorders (including\ndepression) . You may be curious about ADHD and depression in adults. You may\nwonder, \u201d What does depression look like in adults with ADHD? How do we\ndifferentiate between the two? How do I cope with ADHD and depression at the\nsame time?\u201d  \n  \nThis is my personal perspective on ADHD and depression in adults, and I hope\nthat it will help readers.\n\n## **So, what is depression and what does it look like in ADHD adults?**\n\n  \n\nDepression is a mood disorder4. It is characterised by having a low mood for a\nperiod of two weeks or more. In adults, depression can present as withdrawal\nfrom social activities, difficulty with maintaining hygiene, heightened\nirritability, over-eating or under-eating, inadequate or excessive sleeping\nand slowed speech. For people who menstruate, depression can lead to changes\nin the menstrual cycle5.\n\nDepressed individuals may find themselves experiencing feelings of\nworthlessness or guilt. They may lack the energy to perform daily tasks.\nDepressed people lose interest in previously enjoyable activities, and\nfrequently harbour thoughts of self-harm or suicide. A nationwide study showed\nthat one in seven people in Singapore will experience a mental health disorder\nin their lifetime, with depression being the most common disorder6.\nAdditionally, women are more likely to suffer from depression than men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4beb3ce2-3df8-4e72-993d-1280f7841c0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4beb3ce2-3df8-4e72-993d-1280f7841c0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "24eb28cf3db1f7ea008c421ba5f5d47779c7a926cec0202f05d6455cc467347f", "text": "**\n\n  \n\nDepression is a mood disorder4.

A nationwide study showed\nthat one in seven people in Singapore will experience a mental health disorder\nin their lifetime, with depression being the most common disorder6.\nAdditionally, women are more likely to suffer from depression than men.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that mental health conditions can present in a\nmyriad of ways, and that many invisible illnesses like [depression can easily\ngo unnoticed](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/adhd-depression/). Thus, it is\nimportant to check on those whom you suspect may be suffering from mental\nhealth issues. It is crucial to fully understand each individual\u2019s situation.\n\n## **ADHD vs Depression**\n\n  \n\nAHD and depression often overlap. Certain symptoms such as sleeping issues or\ndifficulty concentrating can also be associated with ADHD. As such, it is\nimportant to distinguish between the two so that one can receive proper care.\nHaving lived with major depressive disorder for a few years, here are the ways\nin which I distinguish between depression and ADHD:\n\n**Lack of Interest**  \n  \nThere is a difference between coming out of a hyperfixation and having no\ninterests whatsoever. When I come out of a hyperfixation, there is often a\ngradual loss of interest in the topic before I finally drop it. With\ndepression, the loss of interest is very sudden. Furthermore, it is impossible\nto find fulfillment from previous hyperfixations or hobbies.\n\n**Low Moods**  \n  \nADHDers can cycle through many emotions and feelings throughout the day. With\nthis in mind, how can one tell when they are depressed? In my experience,\ndepression is a constant, low mood throughout the day. The sensation is\nsimilar to having a stone lodged in my chest and being unable to dislodge it.\nChecking on your somatic sensations can also help with determining your mood\n(e.g. feeling pain in the chest when experiencing emotional pain).\n\n**Lack of Energy**\n\nThis is usually a telltale sign of depression for me. It often shows up as a\ndesire to stay in bed for the whole day, a lack of energy to engage in basic\ntasks or the lack of a desire to do anything besides sleep. I also find that a\nlack of motivation often accompanies this loss of energy. On the other hand,\nwith ADHD, that motivation is simply channeled elsewhere (e.g. towards more\ninteresting activities)\n\n## **Coping with Depression**\n\n  \n![Friends realising about ADHD and depression in adults, consoling depressed\nfriend with ADHD](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2022/05/cryingdepression.png)_Image Source:_ [_Crying girl\nphoto created by rawpixel.com \u2013\nwww.freepik.com_](https://www.freepik.com/photos/crying-girl)\n\nThe first step is acknowledging that you need help. Reaching out to a trusted\nperson- be that person be a friend or a loved one- is very important. Asking\nfor help can be overwhelming and daunting, and you may feel weak or afraid.\nThese feelings are completely valid. However, asking for help is never a sign\nof weakness. Reaching out for support is essential for recovery.\n\nTry therapy. Therapy has been shown to help treat and manage not just\ndepression, but also ADHD. Mental health professionals often use Cognitive\nBehavioural Therapy (CBT) to treat both ADHD and depression in adults. As\nsomeone who has undergone CBT, I find it very useful in helping me to manage\nand challenge my depressive thoughts.\n\nConsider medication.

I have found that a\ncombination of medication and therapy work well for me. Selective Serotonin\nReuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are often prescribed for depression. SSRIs help to\nregulate the chemicals in the brain by slowing the re-uptake of serotonin (the\nchemical responsible for mood, among other things) so that it stays in the\nbrain a little longer.\n\n![Even if you are depressed, there is still\nhope](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hope.png)_Image\nSource:_[\n_Wokandapix_](https://pixabay.com/users/wokandapix-614097/?utm_source=link-\nattribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=1804595)\n_from_[ _Pixabay_](https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-\nattribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=1804595)  \n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\n  \n\nDepression can feel overwhelming and everlasting.

In a 1990 study of\noverweight people who seemed to have difficulties experiencing weight loss,\nFleming discovered that ADHD subjects presented \u201cdisturbed eating habits, with\ntypically no regularly planned meals or snacks, and an inability to follow\ndietary plans for any useful length of time.\u201d\n\nThere has been an increasing number of studies that concentrate on the link\nbetween ADHD and obesity. The study by [Altfas in\n2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC130024/) showed [higher\nthan expected rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826981/) of\nADHD in bariatric patients with severe obesity. These years of research show a\nstrong correlation between ADHD and obesity \u2013 so strong, \u201cin fact, that\nsomeone with ADHD is [four times more\nlikely](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-and-obesity-hard-wired-for-weight-\ngain/#:~:text=Its%20symptoms%20may%20actually%20trigger,than%20is%20someone%20without%20ADHD.)\nto become obese than someone without ADHD\u201d. Brain chemistry, poor impulse\ncontrol, and erratic sleeping habits all combine to stimulate unhealthy eating\n\u2013 and to leave them struggling to lose the weight gained.\n\n## **How ADHD can Lead to Obesity**\n\n![](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ADHD-and-\nObesity-2.png)_Source: Vidmir Raic on Pixabay_\n\nAccording to these studies, children with ADHD are indisposed to physical\nactivities, choose to eat less-healthy foods, and consequently have higher\nBMIs than those without ADHD, despite their assumed hyperactivity.

The\nsymptoms of ADHD that make it difficult to focus also make it exceedingly\ndifficult to eat well and exercise on a regular basis.\n\nSome factors of ADHD that can cause Obesity includes:\n\n  1. [**Executive function**](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-executive-function-disorder/#:~:text=The%20following%20six%20clusters%20of,sustaining%20motivation%20and%20processing%20speed) deficits: Maintaining a healthy weight calls for executive function skills, from selecting balanced meals to persevering with an exercise routine. Children with ADHD have inherently weaker executive functioning, which makes starting (and adhering to) a healthy daily routine far more demanding. Parents can supervise diet and physical activities, but keep in mind that children have to do that independently in the future.\n  2.  **Impulsivity** : We are constantly enticed with high-fat and high-sugar food. Most people can control their food-related impulses \u2014 for instance, saying no to a daily cup of bubble tea. Unfortunately, individuals with ADHD-impulsivity find this particularly hard to resist.\n  3.  **Weak interoceptive awareness** : Interoceptive awareness is the ability to recognise, communicate, comprehend, and take appropriate measures to internal signals such as hunger cues, thirst alert, or physical tiredness. A child with ADHD, however, is \u201cdriven by a motor\u201d, unable to be or uncomfortable with being still for long periods of time. Thus, he or she may struggle with body markers, is more likely to interpret those as hunger, and may subsequently resort to food to fulfil that ambiguous internal need.\n  4.  **Sleep disturbance** : Laboratory and epidemiological studies have linked short-sleep duration and poor-sleep quality to obesity risk. Lack of quality sleep creates a hormonal imbalance in the body that promotes overeating. Simultaneously, metabolic compensation is used to preserve and store fat for unforeseen energy use because the body has evolved to prize fat and energy storage, and to signal a calorie deficit as a sign of distress or famine. However, in modern times, it is a countermeasure for children with ADHD. \u201cSleep is the \u2018most sedentary activity\u2019, yet it may be the only one that protects from weight gain\u201d.\n  5.  **\u201cProcrastin-eating\u201d** : This is an interesting occurrence. There is an ADHD tendency to avoid dreary tasks by eating. Snacking on fast food is definitely more appealing to the ADHD brain than doing homework. Therefore, conscious or unconscious binging becomes a damaging form of procrastination.\n  6.  **Low levels of neurotransmitters** : ADHD brains have low levels of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, which is closely linked with dopamine. Dopamine and Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid that works as a neurotransmitter, exist in insufficient amounts in the brains of people with ADHD.\n\n![](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ADHD-and-\nObesity-3.png)_Source: Geralt on Pixabay_\n\nDopamine regulates mood and muscle movement and plays an important role in the\n\u201creward system\u201d of the brain. GABA controls motor inhibition.\n\nPeople with low levels of these neurotransmitters have difficulty picking up\nrestraining signals from the brain. Therefore, a child with ADHD would tend to\neat in excess.\n\nEvidence also suggests that the same low levels of dopamine that cause ADHD\nalso promote overeating.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62ede10d-2dec-4ea6-810e-2763547e9849": {"__data__": {"id_": "62ede10d-2dec-4ea6-810e-2763547e9849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "398aae6e8fbf1fca5675633fbcfdf9b3208dd67081842607b2b2579f308d05e1", "text": "Dopamine and Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid that works as a neurotransmitter, exist in insufficient amounts in the brains of people with ADHD.\n\n![](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ADHD-and-\nObesity-3.png)_Source: Geralt on Pixabay_\n\nDopamine regulates mood and muscle movement and plays an important role in the\n\u201creward system\u201d of the brain.

Therefore, a child with ADHD would tend to\neat in excess.\n\nEvidence also suggests that the same low levels of dopamine that cause ADHD\nalso promote overeating. John Ratey, M.D., professor of psychiatry at Harvard\nMedical School explains that those with ADHD are \u201c[chemically\nwired](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-weight-gain/)\u201d to seek more dopamine,\nand \u201ceating carbohydrates triggers a rush of dopamine in the brain. It\u2019s the\ndrive for the feeling of satiety.\u201d\n\n7\\. **Hormonal development** : Roberto Olivardia, a clinical psychologist at\nHarvard Medical School claims that \u201chormones and puberty definitely play a\nrole in weight gain, as well. Sometimes pre-teens can gain weight as the body\nprepares for a growth spurt in height.\u201d Children with ADHD now have more\naccess to foods, and they are of bigger portions. They are getting more\nindependent hence parents have less control of their children\u2019s eating habits.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that a child with ADHD is destined to a life of\nobesity. Rather, preventing obesity involves an awareness of ADHD\u2019s effect on\ndiet patterns, exercise habits, and general health.\n\n![](https://www.unlockingadhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ADHD-and-\nObesity-4.png)_Source: Silviarita on Pixabay_\n\n## **How to Manage Your Child\u2019s Weight**\n\n  * Plan your family\u2019s meals and snacks ahead of time.\n  * Practice good sleep hygiene, learn how to improve the quality and quantity of your child\u2019s sleep.\n  * Set healthy eating rules, for example, no eating while watching TV, and having meals only at the dining table.\n  * Teach your child mindful eating, for instance keeping a food diary and putting down the fork in-between bites.\n  * Set a good example for your child by making smart food choices and exercise routines.\n  * Get the ADHD treated. ADHD stimulant medications will help your child better observe and regulate his or her behaviors and avoid compulsive eating.\n  * Avoid using the word \u201cdiet.\u201d The term \u201cdiet\u201d has the negative connotation of deprivation.\n  * Stick to a low GI eating plan.\n  * Try meals and snacks high in protein, complex carbs, and fiber.\n  * Try not to micromanage your child.\n\nFor ADHD teens and children who struggle with self-control, adults in their\nlife may encourage them to adopt healthy habits but should refrain from\nimposing too many rules to avoid creating an unhealthy relationship with food.\nParents may engage ADHD children and adolescents in physical, outdoor\nactivities that may help them maintain a healthy weight while having a bonding\nsession. Healthy lifestyle habits are rarely acquired overnight and for them\nto be sustainable requires discipline and willpower while retaining a degree\nof flexibility in eating habits.\n\nOverall, food is meant to be fuel for our bodies and what we eat affects our\nphysical, mental, and emotional states.

Conversely, ADHD can be a massive\nliability when unmanaged or unrealised by us, pointing to the numbers of\nuntreated or undiagnosed individuals in prison, and among those struggling\nwith addiction and unemployment.\n\nAs ADHDers we have within us a titanic wealth of power, creativity and energy\nakin to the Niagara Falls, Dr Hallowell says, which is but a beautiful, empty\ndeluge if not for the hydroelectric plant it is pumped through. In the same\nvein, we need to build our own power plants, channelling our ADHD into avenues\nthat allow us to create value out of life.\n\nHe proposes [Variable Attention Stimulus\nTrait](https://drhallowell.com/2018/10/23/the-future-of-adhd-is-vast/) \u2014 or\nVAST \u2014 as an alternate name to ADHD.\n\n## **Rethinking the ADHD Triad**\n\nIn unwrapping our inherent gifts, we may look no further than the core triad\nof ADHD symptoms as defined by the\n[DSM-V](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm) (Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders): Distractibility, Impulsivity and\nHyperactivity.\n\nDr Hallowell suggests a strength in the flipside of each symptom:\n\n  * Distractibility as curiosity \u2014 our boundless curiosity in the world can mean innovation, formation of new ideas stemming from simple \u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s that?\u201ds. Think Nobel-prize-winning scientist and ADHDer Kary Mullis, who developed the PCR test now used to detect COVID-19. \n\n  * Impulsivity as creativity \u2014 or, creativity as spurs of impulsivity done right.

Conversely, ADHDers would\nthrive in an atmosphere of exploration, discovery and affirmation \u2014 high-\ntrust, low-fear settings.\n\n**_On lack of accessibility to financial support when living with ADHD:_** Dr\nHallowell emphasises the importance of developing \u201c(the other) Vitamin C\u201d \u2014\nfree and infinite Connection to other people \u2014 in our living or working\nenvironments.\n\n**_On disclosing ADHD in the workplace_** : Dr Hallowell advises against\nspecifically disclosing the term ADHD due to persistent surrounding stigma;\ninstead, to highlight your strengths and weaknesses as they are. The best\nworkplace accommodation is in finding a job most suited to your strengths.\n\n**_On steps to take suspecting you have ADHD:_**\n\n  * Educate yourself \u2014 learn and read up on the condition; how it fits you and what changes it suggests. \n  * Modify your environment \u2014 starting with small changes (example: placing your keys in a basket so you don\u2019t lose them) \u2014 and incorporating a coach into your life \u2014 someone to look out for you \n  * Trial of medication with professional guidance. \n\n**_On self-compassion with ADHD:_** Dr Hallowell advises to never worry alone,\nand set to a more realistic goal of liking yourself rather than the act of\nloving yourself.

Melding his hyperactivity and creativity with a\npassion for engineering has enabled a move from homemade air cannons and\ntasers to his later work in assistive technology (example: toy cars for\nchildren with muscular dystrophy) and impact-driven projects (example:\ndeveloping a remotely operated vehicle for monitoring coral reefs).\n\nStick \u2018Em is a natural culmination of his years of innovation and experience\nin robotics teaching, offering affordable STEAM education through robotic kits\nwhich include 3D printed connectors and disposable chopsticks. Children are\nfree to get creative with their chopstick robot designs, equipped with simple\ntools to realise their ideas. Stick \u2018Em hopes to not only nurture creativity\nand problem-solving skills in the youth they reach out to, but forge long-\nlasting communities of young innovators.\n\n## **Advice with Kai (Q &A)**\n\n**_For parents of children with ADHD_** : Kai shares about how his parents\nadapted their parenting style to suit his condition: approaching his\nimpulsivity and temper tantrums with empathy instead of corporal punishment\n(ie. caning).\n\nHe talks about how their \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude towards him, married with a\nrecognition of where his true strengths lay, allowed him to focus on his\nengineering and technical skills instead of stressing over conventional\nacademic success. On the topic of schools and examinations, he suggests that\nasking for extra time accommodations and starting medication would be of great\nhelp.\n\nLastly, he shares about the importance of instilling core values like respect\nfor others and empathy in children\u2014 how his innovations and ideas that have\ncome to be are based on his mother\u2019s central question of \u201cHow useful is this\nfor the world?\u201d\n\n**_On managing weaknesses and burn out_** : In starting his business, Ing Kai\nshares about how it was important for him to recognise his weaknesses\n(example: dealing with logistics) and in turn find people (in his case, his\nco-founder) who could make up for them. He also talks about dealing with micro\nburnouts by being honest and forward with his team \u2014 communicating when he\nneeds days of rest and delegating responsibilities accordingly",
